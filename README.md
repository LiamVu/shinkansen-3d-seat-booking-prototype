# Shinkansen 3D Seat Booking Prototype

Shinkansen 3D seat booking prototype is an example app in iOS utilizing [SceneKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit), an Apple high-level 3D rendering engine, to show possibility of integrating 3D technology to visualize actual spaces which in this case is a Japanese high-speed train's seat map ([Shinkansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen)).

Besides the 3D seat map, this example app also includes some several interesting aspects including an example of [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) methodology workflow that have been implemented in the codebase, and smooth view transition that turns navigational push animation into seamless step by step flow.

## Notable Features

<a name="3d-seat-map"/>

### 3D Seat Map

When talking about 3D in mobile apps, many people are thinking about 3D games right away, but this feature in this prototype will completely change that notion. The feature includes real-time 3D rendering of the high-speed train cabin which allows users to understand the look of the real space and more easily make decision on what and where the seat they want to pick. 

In this feature, we use SceneKit which is one of the built-in framework made by Apple as a 3D framework, and it allows the other part of the apps to have a native behavior as well.

<a name="seamless-view-transition"/>

### Seamless View Transition

View transition animation is a set of animations that occurs when the app suggest to bring from one view to the other. Custom built view transition animations are used in all the in-between views in order to communicate and navigate users in a meaningful and seamless way.

### Atomic Design System

This prototype's atomic design system has been influenced by Brad Frost Atomic Design article which is a methodology to organize design elements into categorized groups. As the design  implementation of the prototype has been broken down into hierarchical components, It allows the app to be structured orderly and very easy to edit and expand.

### Design and 3D Assets

Besides features that are in the prototype app, all design files and 3D assets in this repository are here and open-sourced under the MIT license, so feel free to experiment and play around with those assets!

## Demo
You can install this Shinkansen 3D seat booking prototype app on-the-fly via [Testflight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) by using [this link]().

<a name="compatibility"/>

## Compatibility 

* iOS 11.0+

<a name="developing-requirements"/>

## Developing Requirements

* Xcode 10.2+
* iOS 11.0
* Swift 5+

<a name="build-process"/>

## Build Process

By following the steps, you need to have [Xcode 10.2+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) and [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) already installed, and of course, a Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.

1. You have options to download the repository directly or clone the repository via Git method.
2. After you have the project store locally in your machine, install framework dependencies by running `pod install` command in the repository directory.
3. Then open *Shinkansen 3D Seat Booking Prototype.xcworkspace* file.
4. After *Shinkansen 3D Seat Booking Prototype.xcworkspace* has been opened, you can run the project either in the simulator or physical devices (you need to have change Apple Developer Certificate to be yours before have it run on the devices)
5. Enjoy, be creative, and maybe contribute to the project!

<a name="external-libraries"/>

## External libraries

This project only use a few external libraries, it mostly uses the standard iOS frameworks.

<a name="kumi-ios"/>

### Kumi-iOS

Kumi-iOS is an iOS framework that abstracts common design values into different designer-understandable data objects such as `TextStyle`, `LayerStyle`, `AnimationStyle`, and it also comes with convenience extensions for setting those values into different subclasses of `UIView`.

In this project, Kumi-iOS is used for all design elements, and is deeply as a part of Atomic Design System methodology.

### BrightFutures

BrightFutures is a Swift framework that handle asynchronous code with a handful completion blocks and type-safe error handling.

In this prototype, BrightFutures plays an important role to handle and organize loading method of multiple 3D assets asynchronously.

## Fun Facts

<a name="what-is-scenekit"/>

### What is SceneKit?

<img align="right" width="120" height="120" src="https://github.com/virakri/shinkansen-3d-seat-booking-prototype/blob/master/images/scene-kit-icon-image.png?raw=true">

SceneKit is a high-level 3D graphic API made by Apple to provide an easy-to-use layer over the lower level APIs (Metal.) SceneKit's main features include object based scene graph, physics engine, and particle system.

In this prototype, SceneKit has been used as a main framework to render 3D visualization of the seat map. As `SCNView` that is used to display the seat map is a sub class of `UIView`, it behave like any other subclasses of `UIView`, so that make the whole prototype remains having native look and feel.

### What is Atomic Design System?

<img align="right" width="120" height="120" src="https://github.com/virakri/shinkansen-3d-seat-booking-prototype/blob/master/images/atomic-design-icon-image.png?raw=true">

Atomic Design is a methodology coined by Brad Frost. It is a method of creating and maintaining design system in a thoughtful hierarchies and effective pattern. It consists of collections of reusable components that have been clearly organized and standardized, and they can easily be assembled to be an application. 

This prototype showcase the use of this method in *Design System* folder.
