### Security Disclosure

If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability with Alamofire, you should report it as soon as possible via email to security@alamofire.org. Please do not post it to a public issue tracker.

## Donations?

The [ASF](https://github.com/Alamofire/Foundation#members) is looking to raise money to officially stay registered as a federal non-profit organization.
Registering will allow us members to gain some legal protections and also allow us to put donations to use, tax free.
Donating to the ASF will enable us to:

- Pay our yearly legal fees to keep the non-profit in good status
- Pay for our mail servers to help us stay on top of all questions and security issues
- Potentially fund test servers to make it easier for us to test the edge cases
- Potentially fund developers to work on one of our projects full-time

The community adoption of the ASF libraries has been amazing.
We are greatly humbled by your enthusiasm around the projects, and want to continue to do everything we can to move the needle forward.
With your continued support, the ASF will be able to improve its reach and also provide better legal safety for the core members.
If you use any of our libraries for work, see if your employers would be interested in donating.
Any amount you can donate today to help us reach our goal would be greatly appreciated.
